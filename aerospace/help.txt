defaults write NSGlobalDomain "_HIHideMenuBar" -bool true
```
3. Log out and log back in (or restart your Mac)

This will keep the menu bar permanently hidden. If you need to access it, you can still do so by pressing **Control + F2** (or Fn + Control + F2 on some keyboards) to focus on the menu bar.

To reverse this and make the menu bar appear on hover again, use:
```
defaults delete NSGlobalDomain "_HIHideMenuBar"
